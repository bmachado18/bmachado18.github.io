            <p>Hey! It's me, Brent Machado.</p>
            <p>I'm a Software Engineering undergrad that started post-secondary education in 2018. After pursuing a Bachelor of Sciences for Chemistry up until 2020, I decided
                to chase a deeper inclination to technology and design by attending Software Engineering at UVic. This exciting transition interested me as early as 2016 when I was creating websites with Wordpress,
                and exploring the realm of Pygame in 2018. </p>
            <p>I love creating new things, solving puzzles, and sharing knowledge. This website is my space to share whatever things I come up with. Welcome!</p>
