        <p>
          I am Brent, a Software Engineer who has graduate from the University of Victoria.

        <p>
          I started exploring tech in 2016 through WordPress and game development with Python. Since then, I’ve focused on backend development, working with modern stacks and distributed systems, both in academic projects and research roles. Currently, I’m a Graduate Researcher contributing to backend architecture and data processing workflows.
